I love you too and I hope you can learn to be happy. I also have no interest right now in airing grievances but I think at some point we should try to discuss it all and come to a good place together so we can be friends moving forward. You have given me perspective and my life meaning and its going to be terribly hard adjusting to a new directionless reality. I don't know where I went wrong exactly but it just makes me sad to know respect was lost over time from both directions. You are right, you aren't the correct romantic partner for me. I have tried to deny that fact because you are my friend and confidant forever, but denying it just makes me resent the ways in which you arent as I desire. Thats not fair to you and Im sorry for all of the same transgressions it has caused. I believe in my heart that I have always supported and cherished you big picture and I hope you can agree. There is no right way to go through life but I have no regrets getting to call you mine, a stellar individual somehow mine on this infinite spinning rock.
